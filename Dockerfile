# Cross-compiling multi-arch build with a durable cargo-chef dependency layer.
#
# The builder runs on the NATIVE build platform (`--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM`)
# and cross-compiles to the requested target arch. Previously the builder ran
# under QEMU for linux/arm64, which emulated the *entire* Rust compile and took
# ~2h per release. Cross-compiling on the native runner brings arm64 back to
# minutes; only the tiny runtime layer (ca-certificates) still touches QEMU.
#
# cargo-chef splits the expensive external-crate compile (aws-lc-sys, chromium/
# CDP, tokio, rustls, ...) into its own `cacher` stage keyed ONLY on the Cargo
# manifests (recipe.json). A source-only change leaves recipe.json byte-
# identical -> the cook is reused and only the workspace crates recompile.
#
# DURABILITY: prod (rolling-deploy.sh) bakes the `cacher` stage as a TAGGED
# image `crw-api-deps:<fp>` and overrides DEPS_STAGE to it, so `builder` runs
# `FROM crw-api-deps:<fp>`. Tagged image layers are referenced (not dangling)
# and are NOT build cache, so the nightly `docker image prune -f` +
# `docker builder prune --keep-storage 1GB` cannot evict them. CI leaves
# DEPS_STAGE=cacher (cooks inline; gha mode=max caches the cacher layer).

# Global ARG (before the first FROM) so it is usable in the `builder` FROM line.
ARG DEPS_STAGE=cacher

# Which workspace binaries to cook + build. Default = all three (the public
# open-core image ships crw + crw-server + crw-mcp). Prod overrides it to just
# `-p crw-server --features cdp`: the engine container only runs crw-server
# (CMD), so building crw-cli + crw-mcp there is wasted work — dropping them
# removes two of three thin-LTO links (faster + far less CPU contention with the
# live engine). MUST be identical in the cook and the build (fingerprint match).
ARG CARGO_PKGS="-p crw-server --features cdp -p crw-mcp -p crw-cli"

# Cap on compile parallelism. cargo reads CARGO_BUILD_JOBS natively (BuildKit
# injects a declared ARG into the RUN env), so no -j flag is needed. "default" =
# all cores (CI); prod passes a number below the core count so a build never
# starves the live engine of CPU. Must NOT be empty — cargo rejects an empty
# value ("could not parse ``").
