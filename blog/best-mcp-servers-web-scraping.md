## What Is MCP and Why Does It Matter for Scraping?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that lets AI agents call external tools through a unified interface. Instead of writing custom API integration code for each tool, you configure MCP servers in your agent's config file and the agent can discover and call tools automatically.

For web scraping, MCP is transformative. An AI agent with an MCP scraping server can:

- Scrape any URL on demand as part of its reasoning process
- Crawl entire sites to build context for answering questions
- Extract structured data from pages without custom parsing code
- Map site structures to understand what content is available

The key advantage over traditional API integration: **your agent discovers the scraping tools at runtime**. You don't need to write wrapper functions or teach the agent your API's request/response format. The MCP server advertises its capabilities and the agent calls them directly.

## Detailed Reviews

### 1. CRW — Built-In MCP Server

[CRW](https://github.com/us/crw) is the only web scraping tool with a **built-in MCP server** — no separate package, no additional configuration. When you run CRW, the MCP server is just there. This is the simplest path from "I have a scraper" to "my AI agent can scrape the web."

**Tools provided:**

- `crw_scrape` — extract content from a single URL as markdown, HTML, or structured JSON
- `crw_crawl` — crawl a site and return content from multiple pages
- `crw_check_crawl_status` — check the status of an async crawl job
- `crw_map` — discover all URLs on a site without extracting content
- `crw_search` — search the web and return content from matching pages
- `crw_parse_file` — parse files (including PDFs) and return content as markdown

**MCP client configuration (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):**

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crw": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "ghcr.io/us/crw:latest", "crw-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CRW_API_KEY": "your-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or with the `crw-mcp` binary on PATH (npm package `crw-mcp`; the `crw` PyPI package is the Python SDK client, not the MCP server):

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crw": {
      "command": "crw-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Or if using fastCRW cloud:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crw": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "crw-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CRW_API_KEY": "fc-YOUR_API_KEY",
        "CRW_API_URL": "https://api.fastcrw.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why it stands out:** The built-in approach eliminates a class of operational problems. There's no version mismatch between the MCP wrapper and the scraping engine. No extra dependency to install and keep updated. CRW's low local-first latency means your agent gets fast responses — important because MCP tool calls block the agent's reasoning loop. See the full latency distribution and a one-command repro on our [public benchmark](/benchmarks).

CRW is listed on the official [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/?q=crw), making it discoverable from any MCP-compatible client.

**Limitations:** No dedicated screenshot MCP tool, though the scrape API captures screenshots on an instance with a Chrome-class renderer tier. For complex SPAs that need full Playwright-level browser automation, you might supplement CRW with the Playwright MCP server.

**Best for:** Any AI agent that needs web scraping as a core capability. The lowest-friction path to giving your agent live web access.

### 2. Firecrawl MCP

Firecrawl's MCP server (`@mendableai/firecrawl-mcp`) wraps the Firecrawl API with MCP-compatible tools. It provides the same scrape/crawl/map capabilities as CRW's MCP server, plus structured extraction and additional output formats.

**Setup:**

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mendableai/firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "fc-YOUR_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why it stands out:** Firecrawl MCP benefits from Firecrawl's full feature set — screenshots, PDF parsing, and mature anti-bot handling are all accessible through MCP tools. The structured extraction tool lets your agent request specific JSON schemas from pages.

**Limitations:** Requires the `@mendableai/firecrawl-mcp` npm package — a separate install and dependency. Points to Firecrawl's hosted API by default, so you need an API key and pay per request. Self-hosted mode is possible but requires running the full Firecrawl stack (Node.js, Redis, Playwright).

**Best for:** Teams already using Firecrawl who want to expose its full capabilities to AI agents via MCP.

### 3. Playwright MCP

The [Playwright MCP server](https://github.com/anthropics/mcp-playwright) gives your AI agent full browser automation capabilities. This is not a scraping API — it's a browser that your agent can control step by step: navigate, click, type, scroll, take screenshots, and extract content.

**Tools provided:**

- `browser_navigate` — go to a URL
- `browser_click` — click an element
- `browser_type` — type text into inputs
- `browser_screenshot` — capture the current page
- `browser_get_text` — extract visible text
- And more: scroll, hover, wait, evaluate JavaScript

**Setup:**

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-playwright"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Why it stands out:** Playwright MCP handles anything a real browser can do. Complex SPAs, login flows, multi-step interactions, pages that require scrolling to load content — all are accessible to your agent. Screenshot capture gives the agent visual context about pages.

**Limitations:** Heavy. Launches a full Chromium browser. Much slower per page than CRW or Firecrawl because every interaction is a separate tool call. Returns HTML/text, not clean markdown. Better for targeted interactions than bulk scraping.

**Best for:** Pages that require interaction (clicking buttons, filling forms, scrolling). Visual QA and testing. Pages with complex JavaScript that lighter scrapers can't handle.

### 4. Browserbase MCP

[Browserbase](https://browserbase.com) provides managed headless browsers in the cloud. Their MCP server gives your agent access to these cloud browsers — same capabilities as Playwright MCP, but without running Chrome locally.

**Setup:**

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browserbase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@browserbasehq/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "BROWSERBASE_API_KEY": "your-key",
        "BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID": "your-project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why it stands out:** No local browser installation needed. Browsers run in the cloud with built-in proxy rotation and fingerprint management. Good for teams that want browser automation without the infrastructure overhead of managing Chromium instances.

**Limitations:** Paid service — no free self-hosted option. Adds network latency (your agent talks to a remote browser). Depends on Browserbase's availability. Returns HTML, not markdown.

**Best for:** Teams that need browser automation in CI/CD or serverless environments where running a local browser isn't practical. Production deployments where you don't want to manage Chromium updates.

### 5. Puppeteer MCP

Similar to Playwright MCP, the Puppeteer MCP server provides browser control tools. Puppeteer is the older, Chrome-specific automation library — Playwright is its more modern successor with multi-browser support.

**Tools provided:**

- `puppeteer_navigate` — go to a URL
- `puppeteer_screenshot` — capture the page
- `puppeteer_click` — click an element
- `puppeteer_evaluate` — run JavaScript in the page context

**Why it stands out:** If your team already uses Puppeteer and has existing scripts/selectors, the Puppeteer MCP server lets you reuse that knowledge. The `evaluate` tool is powerful — it lets the agent run arbitrary JavaScript in the page, which is useful for extracting data from complex client-side apps.

**Limitations:** Chrome-only (unlike Playwright). Same heavyweight browser overhead as Playwright MCP. Less actively maintained than Playwright MCP in most distributions. Returns HTML/text, not markdown.

**Best for:** Teams with existing Puppeteer infrastructure who want to expose it to AI agents via MCP without migrating to Playwright.

### 6. Fetch MCP

The Fetch MCP server is the simplest option — it makes HTTP requests and returns the response. No browser, no JavaScript rendering, no complex setup. It's included in many MCP client distributions as a basic tool.

**Tools provided:**

- `fetch` — make an HTTP request (GET, POST, etc.) and return the response body

**Setup:**

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-fetch"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Why it stands out:** Zero dependencies, instant startup, minimal resource usage. For pages that don't require JavaScript rendering — APIs, static sites, RSS feeds, sitemaps — Fetch MCP is all you need. It can optionally convert HTML to markdown using a simple converter.

**Limitations:** No JavaScript rendering. Many modern sites return empty or broken HTML without JS execution. No screenshot capability. No structured extraction. Basically `curl` exposed as an MCP tool.

**Best for:** Fetching API responses, static pages, RSS feeds, or sitemaps. Supplementing a heavier scraper when you know the target doesn't need JS rendering.

### 7. Tavily MCP

[Tavily](https://tavily.com) is a search API built for AI agents. Their MCP server combines web search with content extraction — your agent can search the web and get clean content back in one step.

**Tools provided:**

- `search` — web search with content extraction from top results
- `extract` — extract content from specific URLs

**Setup:**

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tavily": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tavily-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TAVILY_API_KEY": "your-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why it stands out:** Tavily combines search and scraping in one tool. Your agent can answer "find the latest pricing for X" without first searching, then scraping individual results. The search results include extracted content, saving round trips.

**Limitations:** Paid API — no self-hosted option. The extraction is tied to search results, so it's less flexible for scraping specific known URLs. Less control over output format and extraction depth than CRW or Firecrawl.

**Best for:** Agents that need to search the web and extract information from the results. Research agents, question-answering systems, and competitive intelligence tools.

## How to Choose the Right MCP Server

### Decision tree

- **Need web scraping with clean markdown? →** CRW (built-in MCP) or Firecrawl MCP
- **Need browser automation (click, type, interact)? →** Playwright MCP or Browserbase MCP
- **Need web search + extraction? →** Tavily MCP
- **Need simple HTTP fetches? →** Fetch MCP
- **Need screenshots? →** Playwright MCP, Browserbase MCP, or Firecrawl MCP

### Can I use multiple MCP servers together?

Yes — and many teams do. A common pattern is CRW for fast markdown scraping plus Playwright MCP for complex pages that need browser interaction. Your agent can decide which tool to use based on the task. MCP clients support multiple servers simultaneously.

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crw": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "ghcr.io/us/crw:latest", "crw-mcp"]
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-playwright"]
    }
  }
}
```

The agent gets both tool sets and can choose CRW's `scrape` for most pages and fall back to Playwright's `browser_navigate` + `browser_get_text` for complex SPAs.

## Performance Considerations

MCP tool calls are synchronous — your agent waits for the result before continuing. This makes latency critical:

| MCP Server | Typical Latency | Resource Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRW | Low (local-first) | Tiny (single binary) |
| Fetch MCP | Low | Minimal |
| Firecrawl MCP | Higher | Depends on backend |
| Tavily MCP | ~1–3s | Minimal (API call) |
| Playwright MCP | ~3–10s | 500MB+ (browser) |
| Browserbase MCP | ~3–8s | Minimal (cloud) |
| Puppeteer MCP | ~3–10s | 500MB+ (browser) |

CRW's low local-first latency is fast enough that scraping feels like a normal tool call. Browser-based servers (Playwright, Puppeteer, Browserbase) carry a heavier per-operation cost, which adds up when the agent needs to interact with multiple pages. See the full latency distribution and a one-command repro on our [public benchmark](/benchmarks).

## Security Best Practices for MCP Scrapers

- **Always set API keys** — never run an MCP scraper without authentication on a shared network. An unauthenticated scraper is an open proxy.
- **Limit tool scope** — if your agent only needs to scrape specific domains, configure URL allowlists where supported (CRW and Firecrawl both support this).
- **Monitor usage** — MCP tool calls are logged by most MCP clients. Review logs to catch unexpected scraping patterns.
- **Be careful with Playwright/Puppeteer** — these give your agent full browser control, including the ability to navigate to any URL and execute JavaScript. Sandbox appropriately.
- **Prefer local MCP servers for sensitive data** — if scraped content contains PII or proprietary data, self-hosted CRW keeps everything on your infrastructure vs. sending data through a third-party API.

## Getting Started

### Fastest path: CRW built-in MCP

Add this to your MCP client config and you're done:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crw": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "ghcr.io/us/crw:latest", "crw-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Your agent immediately gets `scrape`, `crawl`, `map`, `search`, `parse_file`, and `crawl_status` tools. No API keys needed for local use.

### Managed path: fastCRW cloud MCP

Don't want to run Docker locally? Use [fastCRW](https://fastcrw.com) as the backend:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crw": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "crw-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CRW_API_KEY": "fc-YOUR_KEY",
        "CRW_API_URL": "https://api.fastcrw.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## FAQ

### What is the best MCP server for web scraping?

For most AI agent use cases, fastCRW's built-in MCP server is the best starting point: zero extra setup, clean markdown output, low local-first latency, and scrape, crawl, map, search, and PDF-parse tools out of the box. If you need screenshots, Firecrawl MCP adds that capability. If you need full browser control, add Playwright MCP alongside fastCRW.

### Can I use MCP servers with Claude, GPT, or other LLMs?

Yes. MCP is an open standard supported by Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP-compatible clients. Any MCP server works with any MCP client regardless of which LLM powers it. The protocol is model-agnostic.

### Which tools does the fastCRW MCP server expose?

The crw-mcp server exposes eight tools: scrape, search, crawl, check_crawl_status, map, extract, check_extract_status, and parse_file. Single-URL JSON extraction runs through the scrape tool's json format with a schema; the `extract` tool adds native async multi-URL extraction. Register it in Claude Code with: claude mcp add fastcrw -- npx -y crw-mcp.

### What's the difference between Playwright MCP and fastCRW MCP?

fastCRW MCP is a scraping API: you give it a URL and get back clean markdown. Playwright MCP is browser automation: you control a browser step-by-step (navigate, click, type, screenshot). Use fastCRW for most scraping tasks. Use Playwright when you need to interact with a page (login, fill forms, scroll to load content) or take screenshots.

### Can I run multiple MCP servers at the same time?

Yes, and it's recommended for flexible agents. A common setup is fastCRW (fast scraping) plus Playwright (complex pages) plus Fetch (simple API calls). Your agent chooses the right tool based on the task, and all MCP clients support multiple concurrent servers.

### How accurate is the fastCRW MCP scraper compared to alternatives?

On the public 3-way scrape benchmark — Firecrawl's own scrape-content-dataset-v1, 1,000 URLs with 819 labeled, harness diagnose_3way.py, run 2026-05-08 — fastCRW reached 63.74% truth-recall (522 of 819 labeled URLs), ahead of Crawl4AI at 59.95% and Firecrawl at 56.04%. Its p50 latency was 1914ms — the fastest of the three. In fast mode, its p90 is 4348ms, the lowest of the three (Crawl4AI 4754ms, Firecrawl 6937ms).
