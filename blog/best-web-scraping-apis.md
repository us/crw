## What Makes a Good Web Scraping API for AI?

AI agents and LLM pipelines have different requirements than traditional scraping. You need clean markdown output (not raw HTML), fast response times (agents wait synchronously), structured extraction (JSON from pages), and ideally MCP support so your agent can call the scraper as a tool. Cost per page matters more when you're scraping thousands of pages into a RAG pipeline.

This guide evaluates eight scraping APIs against these AI-specific criteria. We include both hosted services and self-hostable options, because many teams want to control their scraping infrastructure.

## Detailed Reviews

### 1. CRW / fastCRW

[CRW](https://github.com/us/crw) is an open-source, Rust-based web scraping API that implements the Firecrawl REST interface. It's a single small static binary with no Redis or Playwright dependencies and no headless-browser memory baseline. [fastCRW](https://fastcrw.com) is the managed cloud version.

**Why it stands out for AI:** CRW was built specifically for AI agent use cases. The built-in MCP server means your Claude, GPT, or custom agent gets `scrape`, `crawl`, and `map` tools with zero extra configuration. Latency is low and predictable because there is no browser render in the request path — fast enough for synchronous agent tool calls without timeout issues.

**API example:**

```
curl https://api.fastcrw.com/v1/scrape \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "formats": ["markdown"]}'
```

**Pricing:** Self-hosted is free (AGPL-3.0). fastCRW cloud starts with a one-time lifetime 500 credits (not a monthly meter), then pay-as-you-go across Hobby, Standard, Growth, and Scale tiers — see [fastcrw.com/pricing](https://fastcrw.com/pricing) for current tiers (single source of truth). Significantly cheaper per-page than Firecrawl or proxy-based APIs at volume.

**Limitations:** No screenshot support yet (on the roadmap). No PDF/DOCX parsing. Anti-bot handling is partial — sites with aggressive bot detection may need a proxy layer on top. JavaScript rendering via LightPanda is maturing but not at Playwright-level reliability for complex SPAs.

**Best for:** AI agents needing live web access, RAG pipelines, teams wanting Firecrawl compatibility at lower cost and higher speed.

### 2. Firecrawl

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) is a JavaScript/Node.js scraping platform with REST endpoints for `/scrape`, `/crawl`, `/map`, and structured extraction. It's the most feature-complete scraping API for AI use cases, with screenshot capture, PDF parsing, and polished SDKs in Python, JavaScript, Go, and Rust.

**Why it stands out:** Firecrawl defined the modern "scraping API for LLMs" category. Its markdown output is well-tuned, the SDK ecosystem is mature, and it handles JavaScript-heavy SPAs through Playwright. The self-hosted version is available under AGPL-3.0.

**Pricing:** Free tier with 500 credits. Paid plans start at $19/month. Self-hosted is free but requires more infrastructure (Redis, Playwright, ~1GB RAM minimum).

**Limitations:** Higher latency from the per-request browser render. Self-hosting requires multiple services (Redis, workers, browser) and a large multi-service image. Per-request cost is higher than CRW at scale.

**Best for:** Teams needing screenshots, PDF parsing, or the most mature SDK ecosystem. Good choice when feature breadth matters more than speed or cost.

### 3. Apify

[Apify](https://apify.com) is a full web scraping and automation platform. Rather than a single scraping endpoint, it offers an "actor" marketplace — pre-built scrapers for specific sites (Amazon, Google, Twitter, etc.) plus a framework for building custom actors in JavaScript or Python.

**Why it stands out:** The actor marketplace means you often don't need to write scraping logic at all. Apify handles proxy rotation, scheduling, result storage, and webhook notifications. The platform is battle-tested at enterprise scale.

**Pricing:** $5/month free tier (includes some compute and storage). Pay-as-you-go scales with compute units consumed. Can get expensive for high-volume continuous scraping.

**Limitations:** Not purpose-built for AI/LLM workflows — you need to add markdown conversion yourself. Latency varies by actor. No native MCP support. Not self-hostable. The platform learning curve is steeper than a simple REST API.

**Best for:** Teams that need pre-built scrapers for specific sites, complex automation workflows, or enterprise-scale scheduling and storage.

### 4. ScrapingBee

[ScrapingBee](https://scrapingbee.com) is a proxy-based scraping API that handles JavaScript rendering, CAPTCHA solving, and proxy rotation. You send a URL, it returns HTML. Simple and reliable for basic extraction.

**Why it stands out:** ScrapingBee's simplicity is its strength. One API call, one HTML response. It handles headless Chrome rendering and residential proxy rotation behind the scenes. Good documentation and responsive support.

**Pricing:** 1,000 free credits on signup. Plans from $49/month for 150,000 credits. JavaScript rendering costs 5 credits per request vs 1 for static pages.

**Limitations:** Returns raw HTML — no native markdown output. No structured extraction. No MCP support. Not self-hostable. You need your own HTML-to-markdown conversion for AI pipelines.

**Best for:** Simple HTML extraction where you handle the parsing yourself. Good for teams that already have their own markdown conversion pipeline.

### 5. ScraperAPI

[ScraperAPI](https://scraperapi.com) is similar to ScrapingBee — a proxy-based API that handles rendering, CAPTCHAs, and rotation. It differentiates on pricing (generous free tier) and geo-targeting options.

**Why it stands out:** ScraperAPI's recurring monthly free allotment (5,000 requests) is among the most generous of any proxy-based API. The API is straightforward — append your URL to the ScraperAPI endpoint and get HTML back. Supports geotargeting, custom headers, and session persistence.

**Pricing:** 5,000 free requests/month. Paid plans from $29/month. Competitive per-request pricing at scale.

**Limitations:** HTML output only — no markdown, no structured extraction. No MCP support. Not self-hostable. Similar to ScrapingBee, you need to build the AI integration layer yourself.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious teams that need reliable proxy rotation and don't mind handling HTML-to-markdown conversion themselves.

### 6. Bright Data

[Bright Data](https://brightdata.com) (formerly Luminati) operates the world's largest proxy network — 72M+ residential IPs across every country. Their Web Scraper API sits on top of this network, handling rendering, unlocking, and data extraction.

**Why it stands out:** If your scraping is blocked by geo-restrictions or aggressive anti-bot systems, Bright Data's proxy network is unmatched. They also offer pre-built "datasets" — structured data from popular sites that's updated on a schedule, so you don't need to scrape at all.

**Pricing:** Pay-per-result pricing varies by data type. The proxy network starts at $5.04/GB for datacenter proxies, $8.40/GB for residential. Can get expensive at scale, but the unblocking rate justifies the cost for difficult targets.

**Limitations:** Complex pricing model. No native markdown output for AI. No MCP support. The platform is enterprise-focused — overkill for simple scraping tasks. Setup and configuration are more involved than simpler APIs.

**Best for:** Scraping sites with aggressive anti-bot protection. Geo-targeted data collection. Enterprise teams that need the highest unblocking rates.

### 7. Zyte

[Zyte](https://zyte.com) (formerly Scrapinghub, the company behind Scrapy) offers Zyte API — an AI-powered extraction API that returns structured data from web pages. It specializes in e-commerce and product data extraction.

**Why it stands out:** Zyte's automatic extraction uses ML models trained on specific page types (product pages, articles, job listings). You get structured JSON back without writing extraction rules. The Scrapy heritage means deep expertise in large-scale crawling.

**Pricing:** Pay-per-request with free trial credits. Article extraction is cheaper than product extraction. Pricing varies by extraction type and volume.

**Limitations:** Extraction models are tuned for specific page types — less flexible for arbitrary pages. No native markdown output. No MCP support. The ML extraction can be unpredictable on pages that don't match trained patterns.

**Best for:** E-commerce data extraction. Teams scraping product pages, pricing data, or structured content at scale.

### 8. Crawl4AI

[Crawl4AI](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) is an open-source Python library and optional REST service focused specifically on AI extraction. It provides chunking strategies for LLMs, custom Python hooks, screenshot support, and deep crawl orchestration.

**Why it stands out:** Crawl4AI is built for Python AI/ML teams. The chunking strategies are designed for LLM context windows. Custom extraction hooks give fine-grained control. The async architecture handles concurrent scraping well on a single machine.

**Pricing:** Free and open-source (Apache-2.0). Self-host only — no managed cloud service.

**Limitations:** Python-only. Docker image is ~2GB (bundles Chromium). Higher latency than Rust-based alternatives. REST API server mode is less mature than the Python library. No managed hosting option means you handle all the ops.

**Best for:** Python teams that want deep customization of the extraction pipeline. Research teams and data scientists who prefer working directly in Python.

## How to Choose: Decision Framework

### Start with your primary constraint

- **Speed matters most →** fastCRW (no browser in the request path) or self-hosted CRW
- **Feature completeness matters most →** Firecrawl (screenshots, PDFs, SDKs)
- **Budget matters most →** CRW self-hosted (free) or ScraperAPI (generous free tier)
- **Anti-bot handling matters most →** Bright Data (largest proxy network)
- **Python customization matters most →** Crawl4AI (deep hooks, async)
- **Pre-built scrapers matter most →** Apify (actor marketplace)
- **E-commerce extraction matters most →** Zyte (ML-powered product extraction)

### For AI agent integration specifically

If you're building an AI agent that needs live web access, the key differentiators are: MCP support, markdown output quality, and response latency. CRW/fastCRW leads on all three — built-in MCP, clean markdown, and low latency with no browser in the request path. Firecrawl is the runner-up with a separate MCP package and good markdown, but pays a per-request browser render cost. The proxy-based APIs (ScrapingBee, ScraperAPI, Bright Data) return HTML and have no MCP support, so they require more integration work for AI use cases.

### For RAG pipelines

RAG pipelines care about: markdown quality, crawl coverage (percentage of pages successfully extracted), and cost per page at volume. CRW scores well on all three — on a labeled public benchmark it reached 63.74% truth-recall (522 of 819 labeled URLs) with 91.8% scrape success (of reachable URLs) and 0 errors, plus fast per-page extraction and free self-hosting (full distribution + one-command repro on /benchmarks). Firecrawl handles more edge cases (PDFs, complex SPAs). For large-scale RAG ingestion, the cost difference between self-hosted CRW and a paid API compounds significantly.

## Pricing Comparison at Scale

Pricing gets interesting at volume. Here's a rough comparison for 100,000 pages/month:

| API | ~Cost for 100K pages/mo | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRW (self-hosted) | $5–12/mo | Server cost only, no per-page fees |
| fastCRW (cloud) | Varies by plan | Pay-as-you-go, starts with 500 free credits |
| Firecrawl | $199+/mo | Growth plan, depending on page complexity |
| Apify | $49–199/mo | Depends on compute units consumed |
| ScrapingBee | $99–249/mo | Depends on JS rendering usage |
| ScraperAPI | $49–149/mo | Depends on concurrency needs |
| Bright Data | $200+/mo | Varies significantly by proxy type |
| Zyte | $100+/mo | Varies by extraction type |
| Crawl4AI | $5–20/mo | Server cost only (needs larger VM than CRW) |

Self-hosted CRW is the clear winner on cost. With no headless-browser memory baseline, you can run it on the cheapest VPS available and still handle significant volume.

## MCP Integration: The AI Agent Differentiator

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/blog/mcp-web-scraping) is becoming the standard way AI agents access external tools. For web scraping, MCP support means your agent can call the scraper as a native tool — no custom API integration code needed.

- **CRW:** Built-in MCP server. Add it to your MCP client config and your agent gets `scrape`, `crawl`, and `map` tools immediately. Zero extra packages or configuration.
- **Firecrawl:** Separate MCP package (`@mendableai/firecrawl-mcp`). Works well but requires an additional npm install and configuration step.
- **Others:** No native MCP support. You'd need to write a custom MCP server wrapper around these APIs — possible but more work than using a tool that already supports it.

## API Design Comparison

CRW and Firecrawl share the same REST API design — CRW is a Firecrawl-compatible implementation. This means code written for one works with the other by changing the base URL. The key endpoints:

```
# Scrape a single page
POST /v1/scrape  {"url": "...", "formats": ["markdown"]}

# Crawl a site
POST /v1/crawl   {"url": "...", "limit": 100}

# Map site structure
POST /v1/map     {"url": "..."}
```

The proxy-based APIs (ScrapingBee, ScraperAPI, Bright Data) use simpler GET-based interfaces — pass the target URL as a parameter and get HTML back. This is simpler for basic use cases but less expressive for AI workflows that need format control, crawl orchestration, or structured extraction.

Apify and Zyte have their own APIs designed around their specific platforms. Both are more complex than the Firecrawl-style API but offer more platform-specific features (actors, datasets, ML extraction).

## Self-Hosting vs. Managed: When to Choose Each

### Self-host when:

- You're scraping at volume and want to minimize per-page costs
- You need full control over the scraping infrastructure (compliance, data residency)
- You're comfortable managing a Docker container or binary on a VPS
- You want to avoid vendor lock-in

### Use managed when:

- You don't want to manage infrastructure
- You need built-in proxy rotation and anti-bot handling
- Your volume is low enough that per-page pricing is acceptable
- You need an SLA with support

CRW gives you both options with the same API: self-host the open-source binary, or use [fastCRW cloud](https://fastcrw.com). Your client code doesn't change.

## FAQ

### Which web scraping API is fastest for AI agents in 2026?

CRW / fastCRW posts low, predictable latency because there is no browser render in the default path — fast enough for synchronous agent tool calls without timeout issues. On the 3-way scrape benchmark (Firecrawl's public dataset, 819 labeled URLs, run 2026-05-08) CRW's p50 was 1914 ms — the fastest of the three — versus Firecrawl's 2305 ms. In fast mode, CRW's p90 was 4348 ms, the lowest of the three tested.

### Which web scraping API has the best AI agent support?

CRW has the strongest native AI agent support: a built-in MCP server, clean markdown output, and fast response times for synchronous tool calls. Firecrawl is second, with a separate MCP package (@mendableai/firecrawl-mcp). The proxy-based APIs — ScrapingBee, ScraperAPI, Bright Data — have no MCP support and return raw HTML, so they need extra integration work for AI use cases.

### Can I use CRW as a Firecrawl replacement?

For HTML scraping, crawling, and structured extraction: yes. CRW implements the Firecrawl REST API, so you change the base URL and existing code keeps working. For screenshots, PDF parsing, and complex SPAs, CRW does not yet match Firecrawl's feature coverage — a screenshot request returns HTTP 422.

### What is the cheapest web scraping API for high volume?

Self-hosting CRW is the cheapest option — it is free under AGPL-3.0, so you pay only for your own server, and a small VPS handles moderate volume. For a managed service, fastCRW's Free tier gives 500 one-time lifetime credits, then paid tiers cover Hobby through Scale (see fastcrw.com/pricing for current tiers and any active launch pricing). Proxy-based APIs like Bright Data and ScrapingBee cost more per page but may be necessary for sites with aggressive anti-bot protection.

### Which scraping API is most accurate for a RAG pipeline?

Accuracy decides how much usable text reaches your vector store. On Firecrawl's public scrape-content-dataset-v1 (1,000 URLs, 819 labeled), CRW reached the highest truth-recall of the three tools tested — 63.74% (522 of 819 labeled URLs), ahead of Crawl4AI's 59.95% and Firecrawl's 56.04% (harness diagnose_3way.py, 2026-05-08). CRW also posted ~92% scrape success of reachable URLs with 0 thrown errors across 3,000 requests, and recovers 34 URLs neither competitor reaches.

### How many credits does a scrape, crawl, or search request cost on fastCRW?

A scrape costs 1 credit, or 2 when the chrome-stealth renderer fallback is used. A crawl costs 1 credit per page, a search costs 1 per query, and a map costs 1. Any request that uses the json/extract format costs 5 credits. Self-hosting the AGPL-3.0 engine has no per-request fees at all.
