# fastCRW `/v2` ↔ Firecrawl v2 — behaviour diff

**Scope:** the `/v2/*` Firecrawl-compat surface. Our native `/v1` is unchanged.
**Closes the action item in `COMPATIBILITY-firecrawl.md` §3** ("add concrete
field-by-field diff for `metadata` and error envelope before any page claims
drop-in").

Everything below marked **captured** was observed by driving
`api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape` at `mock.fastcrw.com` — the same fixture URLs the
parity suite drives crw at. Run `./run.sh capture mock` to refresh; the
fixtures live in `fixtures/firecrawl_v2/mock_*.json`.

---

## 1. The rule

Firecrawl decides success in `scrapeURL/index.ts`:

```js
const isGoodStatusCode = (statusCode >= 200 && statusCode < 300) || statusCode === 304;
const hasRequiredOutput = isParsedImage || isLongEnough || !isGoodStatusCode;
if (hasRequiredOutput) return engineResult;
throw new EngineUnsuccessfulError(engine);
```

`!isGoodStatusCode` is an **OR term**, so a bad status is *sufficient* to accept
the result — even with an empty body. `controllers/v2/scrape.ts` then never reads
`metadata.statusCode` at all; it falls through to
`res.status(200).json({success: true, data: doc})`.

> **In Firecrawl, `success:false` means _its own infrastructure_ failed — DNS,
> timeout, every engine dead, a policy block. It never means "the target said
> 404."** The status lives in `data.metadata.statusCode` and the reason phrase in
> `data.metadata.error`.

Captured, for every one of 401/403/404/429/500/503:

```text
HTTP 200  {"success":true,"data":{"metadata":{
            "statusCode":404,"error":"Not Found", ...}}}
```

Two consequences that drove the fix:

1. Our old gate (`ScrapeData::http_error`) was **size-dependent** — it only fires
   under `ERROR_PAGE_MAX_TEXT` (200 bytes) — so the same site returned
   `success:false` for a terse 404 and `success:true` for a chatty one.
2. An empty body is only a failure when the status was *good*, because
   `isLongEnough` and `!isGoodStatusCode` are alternatives. **404 + empty body =
   success. 200 + empty body = failure.**

## 2. What changed

| # | Divergence | Now |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 4xx/5xx target → `success:false` | `success:true`, `metadata.statusCode`, `metadata.error` = reason phrase |
| 2 | `metadata.url` aliased to `sourceURL` — the post-redirect URL was invisible | `metadata.url` = final URL (`PageMetadata.final_url`, stamped from the `FetchResult.final_url` that already existed) |
| 3 | no `metadata.error` | present on any status ≥ 400, Firecrawl's exact bare reason phrase |
| 4 | error envelope used `errorCode` only; both SDKs read `code` | emits **both** — `code` in Firecrawl's taxonomy, `errorCode` kept so the SaaS `RequestLog` still resolves |
| 5 | DNS failure 422, timeout 504, binary 422 | 200 / 408 / 500, per `controllers/v2/scrape.ts` |
| 6 | 200-with-empty-body → 200 `{success:false}` | 500 `SCRAPE_ALL_ENGINES_FAILED` |

Implementation is `routes/v2/error.rs` (new) plus `v2_verdict` in
`routes/v2/scrape.rs`. `/v1` is untouched: `http_error()` is still what the
native surface, crawl and batch consult — only this compat surface stopped
asking.

### Parity result

```text
before:  7/23 match Firecrawl v2
after:  21/21 match Firecrawl v2      (4 rows recorded, not asserted — §4)
```

---

## 3. The one deliberate deviation

**A vendor wall served with HTTP 200 still fails for us; Firecrawl returns it.**

A Cloudflare "Just a moment..." shell has text, so `isLongEnough` is true and
Firecrawl hands the interstitial back as the page's content. We have already paid
for that behaviour — see `is_cdn_origin_error` in `crw-crawl`:

> `sacg.me` behind a dead origin was returned as `success: true` with "The
> initial connection between Cloudflare's network and the origin web server timed
> out" as its markdown, billed, and counted as a completed crawl page — for one
> customer, on the same source, since June.

Copying it back would re-open a closed, customer-visible bug. On a 4xx/5xx the
wall does *not* fail — the status already explains the page, which is the case
this whole change is about. Pinned by
`v2_verdict::vendor_wall_on_a_200_still_fails` and its `_on_a_403_` sibling.

---

## 4. Rows recorded but not matched

`mock_parity.py` prints these as `[note]`; `CAPABILITY_GAP` names the first two.
Matching Firecrawl's *contract* does not mean copying its extraction failures.

| Fixture | Firecrawl (captured) | crw |
|---|---|---|
| `/csv` — a 3-line valid CSV | **500** `SCRAPE_RETRY_LIMIT (document_antibot)` | parsed, 200 |
| `/html/malformed` — real prose behind unclosed tags | **500** `SCRAPE_ALL_ENGINES_FAILED` | parsed, 200 |
| `/redirect/loop` | never answered; held the connection past a 120s read timeout | 500 `SCRAPE_ALL_ENGINES_FAILED`, promptly |
| `/wall/captcha` | 408 `CONCURRENCY_QUEUE_TIMEOUT` — a capacity artifact of their side, not a verdict | 200, `success:true`, statusCode 403 |

The `/wall/captcha` row needs a clean re-capture. Its 401 and 429 siblings both
captured cleanly and both confirm the status-code rule, so nothing here is
load-bearing.

---

## 5. Still open

- **`/v2/crawl` + `/v2/batch/scrape` status envelope.** We omit `createdAt`,
  `completedAt`, `duration` and the robots/thin-crawl `warning` that
  `crawl-status.ts` emits. Our capture predates them, so recapture before
  chasing. We also carry an extra `blocked` counter — intentional, the SaaS
  bills off it.
- **Invalid crawl job id.** Firecrawl answers `400 {"success":false,"error":
  "Invalid job ID"}`; we hit axum's `Path<Uuid>` rejection and return plain text,
  which no SDK can parse.
- **`/v2/map`, `/v2/search`, `/v2/extract` error paths** — undiffed on both
  sides. Happy paths match.
- **Browser-tier fixtures.** The parity run uses `renderer.mode = "none"`, so the
  `/js/*` CSR group (7 fixtures) is unexercised. The envelope logic under test is
  tier-independent, but the escalation behaviour is not — a plain origin 500 was
  measured escalating through chrome *and* lightpanda before this change.
- **The `/lie/*` group** (3 fixtures) has no expectation on either side.
