//! LLM meaningful-change judge for change-tracking / monitors.
//!
//! Given a monitoring `goal` and a page diff, decide whether the change is
//! meaningful for that goal. Reuses the provider-call machinery in
//! [`crate::structured`] (forced tool-use against a fixed schema). Pure judge:
//! it returns data only and never executes model output.
//!
//! ## Prompt-injection defense
//! The diff is untrusted, scraped content. It is wrapped via
//! [`crate::untrusted::wrap`] in nonce-bearing `UNTRUSTED:DIFF` delimiters and
//! the system instruction tells the model to treat it strictly as data and
//! ignore any instructions inside it.
