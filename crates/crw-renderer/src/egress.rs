//! Per-host egress memory: remember which hosts hard-block our direct egress.
//!
//! Without this, every URL on a blocking host re-climbs the whole renderer
//! ladder from scratch (`direct → 429 → proxy retry → JS ladder → hard block →
//! chrome_proxy`), because the block signal lives in request-local state and
//! dies at function exit. On a site that 429s us that costs 10-20s *per URL*.
//!
//! ## The latch is a TTL cache, not a state machine
//!
//! Presence in the cache == "this host recently hard-blocked our direct egress".
//! Everything else falls out of the TTL, with no explicit probe/clear code:
//!
//! - within the TTL  → [`should_proxy`] is true → try the proxy egress first;
//! - TTL expires     → entry is gone → direct is tried again. *That expiry is
//!   the half-open probe*;
//! - blocked again   → [`note_block`] re-inserts and the TTL resets (re-latch);
//! - recovered       → nothing to do; the entry already expired.
//!
//! This is deliberately not built on [`crate::preference::HostPreferences`]:
//! its `record_success` fires regardless of which tier succeeded, so a latch
//! living there would be erased by the very proxied success it produced. A TTL
//! cache needs no success hook, so nothing can erase it by mistake.
//!
//! ## The latch reorders egress; it never suppresses direct
//!
//! A latched host is *preferred* onto the proxy, but the caller must still keep
//! [`DIRECT_FALLBACK_RESERVE`] of its deadline so a failing — or, worse,
//! *hanging* — proxy can always fall back to a direct attempt. Suppressing
//! direct outright would mean a falsely-latched host whose proxy egress is worse
//! (origin blocks the proxy ranges, proxy down, geo exit trips another wall) has
//! no way to recover for the whole cooldown, which is how this could push scrape
//! success below the 89.7% red line.
//!
//! ## Writes are direct-only
//!
//! Only a block observed on a genuine [`EgressKind::Direct`] attempt may latch a
//! host. A block seen while already egressing through a proxy says the *proxy*
//! is blocked and says nothing about direct — latching on it would let one
//! caller's broken proxy demote every other caller's healthy direct traffic onto
//! paid bandwidth.

///     and the check. A `>= 8s` gate therefore never opens on an 8s budget, and any
///     test pinned to that boundary is decided by clock resolution.
