//! `GET /v1/capabilities` — surface what this opencore instance supports.
//!
//! SaaS / dashboard frontends call this on boot to decide which provider
//! buttons / formats to surface. Closes the "SaaS UI shipped before
//! opencore rollout" silent-failure mode by giving callers a way to ask
//! "do you actually do this?" before making a real request.
//!
//! CONTRACT — every boolean here is DERIVED from the real build (cargo
//! features) and the effective config. A capability is `true` only when this
//! instance can perform the operation for a well-formed request that supplies
//! NO extra credentials. Nothing is hardcoded to `true`.
//!
//! Credentials are reported separately rather than folded into the booleans:
//!
//! * `llm.serverKeyConfigured` — a server-side LLM key is present.
//! * `formats.llmRequired` — the formats that need an LLM: a server key, or a
//!   per-request `llmApiKey` (BYOK is always accepted and cannot be disabled).
//!
//! So a BYOK-only deploy reports `search.answer: false` (it cannot answer
//! without a caller-supplied key) alongside `search.supported: true` — a caller
//! that sends `llmApiKey` still gets answers.
