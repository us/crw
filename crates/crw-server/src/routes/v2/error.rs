//! Firecrawl-shaped error responses for the `/v2` compat surface.
//!
//! `AppError` is our native mapping and stays exactly as it is — `/v1` is our
//! documented API and its callers branch on its status codes and `errorCode`
//! spellings today. This wrapper exists so `/v2` can answer the way Firecrawl
//! answers without dragging `/v1` along.
//!
//! Two things differ from `AppError`:
//!
//! 1. **The key.** Firecrawl's envelope is `{success, code, error}`. Both
//!    official SDKs read `code`; our `errorCode` is invisible to every one of
//!    their error paths. We emit `code` with Firecrawl's spelling AND keep
//!    `errorCode` with ours — their SDKs ignore unknown keys, and the SaaS
//!    reads `errorCode` for `RequestLog` (`upstreamErrorCode` in
//!    `api-handler.ts`), so dropping it would blind our own request log.
//!
//! 2. **The status.** Firecrawl's `controllers/v2/scrape.ts` maps a handful of
//!    codes explicitly and lets everything else fall to
//!    `timeoutErr ? 408 : 500`. Notably a DNS failure is **HTTP 200** with
//!    `success:false`, not a 4xx.
