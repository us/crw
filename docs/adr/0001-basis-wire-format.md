# ADR 0001: Basis wire format (per-field extraction evidence)

- Status: accepted
- Applies to: `crw-core::evidence`, `crw-extract::{structured, basis}`,
  `crw-server` extract/scrape routes, `/v1/capabilities`.
- Wire version: `basisVersion = 1` (`crw_core::evidence::BASIS_VERSION`).

## Context

Structured extraction (`formats:["json"]` on scrape, and `/v1/extract`) returns
a schema-valid object, but the caller has no way to know *where* each value came
from or whether the model grounded it in the page at all. Downstream agent
workflows need a machine-checkable answer to "can I trust this field?" without a
second, human, verification pass.

The requirement is honesty, not completeness: a field that cannot be verified
must say so. The system must never emit a fabricated attribution.

## Decision

### 1. One evidence type, extended in place

`crw-core::evidence` already shipped `Basis` and `EvidenceCitation`, reserved
for this and with zero consumers. We extend those types rather than introduce a
competing one. `value` becomes `Option` (so `notFound` is representable),
`status: FieldStatus` is added, `confidence` stays the qualitative
`low|medium|high` vocabulary shared with change-tracking, and `reasoning`
becomes optional and is not requested in v1.

### 2. Status is the honesty contract

`FieldStatus = supported | unverified | unsupported | notFound` (camelCase on
the wire). The invariants are testable and enforced:

| status | `value` | `citations` | `citation.excerpt` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `supported` | non-null | exactly 1 | present, verbatim in the source, and it carries the value |
| `unverified` | non-null | exactly 1 | `None` |
| `unsupported` | non-null | empty | n/a |
| `notFound` | `null` | empty | n/a |

- `citations` is empty **iff** status is `unsupported` or `notFound`.
- An excerpt is present **only** on `supported`.
- `unverified`: the document is real and attributable, the span within it is
  not established. `unsupported`: no attribution survives; the value is kept but
  explicitly untrusted.

### 3. Basis is produced in the same tool call; the server hashes the source

The extraction LLM call is extended to return, per top-level scalar leaf,
`{ value, sourceUrl, excerpt, confidence }` inside the same tool call. A second
verifier call is rejected: it doubles the LLM leg for no deterministic gain, and
the deterministic half of verification is done server-side for free.

The `sourceHash` is **not** model-produced. The server stamps it.

Canonical source text = the normalized, cleaned, truncated markdown actually
sent to the model (the exact bytes after the clean/markdown pipeline and after
`truncate_md`). It is hashed **before** the call:

```
EvidenceCitation.sourceHash     = "sha256:" + hex(sha256(canonical_source_text))
EvidenceCitation.sourceTextKind = "llmInput"
```

This is deliberately **not** the same hash as `ScrapeData.sourceHash`
(`crw_diff::snapshot::hash_markdown`, bare hex over the *full* normalized
markdown). `sourceTextKind` is the disambiguator. Both hashes are surfaced per
document: `ScrapeData.sourceHash` (full markdown, for change-tracking and
re-scrape correlation) and `llmInputHash` (the truncated `llmInput` text,
matching every citation's `sourceHash`).

### 4. Alignment: null, unsupported and hallucinated fields (server-side)

Schema validation runs first, unchanged; `data` that survives it is
authoritative and is never rewritten. Basis-value alignment then runs
deterministically (`crw_extract::basis::align_basis`):

1. **Document check** — `citation.url` must match the document the server
   fetched, and the recorded hash must match. A URL the model invented is not in
   the set. Fail → citation dropped → `unsupported`.
2. **Value check** — the model's claimed `value` must equal `data[field]`. Fail
   → citation dropped → `unsupported` (the model contradicted itself; `data`
   wins and is never rewritten).
3. **Excerpt containment** — the excerpt must be a verbatim substring of the
   canonical source text (whitespace-collapsed on both sides so a reflow is not
   punished). Fail → `excerpt = None` → `unverified`.
4. **Value-carried** — the excerpt must actually carry the value (not a trivial
   one-character substring). Fail → `unverified`.

A leaf with no basis → `unsupported`. A null leaf → `notFound`.

**A basis/value mismatch fails the test suite.** `status: "supported"` with an
empty citation list, a hash the server did not record, or an excerpt not in the
source, is a hard test failure. This is what makes the contract load-bearing
rather than decorative.

### 5. Capabilities

`Capabilities.extract.perFieldAttribution` is flipped from the hardcoded `false`
to report the truth of the running build. A client that gates its evidence UI on
this flag must not be told `false` by a binary that honours the flag.

## Scope (v1)

**In:** top-level scalar properties (string, number, integer, boolean); 0 or 1
citations per leaf; substring-containment excerpt verification with no offsets
stored.

**Out** (`charStart`/`charEnd` stay `None`): character offsets and offset-based
re-verification, RFC 6901 JSON Pointer leaf paths, nested/array/repeated field
semantics (non-scalar properties carry no evidence entry), multi-citation
leaves, and an extraction-provenance benchmark.

## Honest limits of what these checks prove

- Containment proves the excerpt is *on the page*, not that it is the *right*
  span for the value. The value-carried check narrows this but cannot prove
  semantic relevance for every type.
- Booleans are exempt from the value-carried check: a literal `true` essentially
  never appears in prose ("In stock" grounds `true`), so demanding it be quoted
  would make `supported` unreachable for every boolean. A boolean still passes
  the document, value-equality and excerpt-in-source checks. Disclosed limit.
- The model can still emit a real excerpt that happens to contain the value by
  coincidence. The layer catches fabrication (invented URL, wrong hash, absent
  excerpt), not every possible mis-grounding.

## Consequences

- Ships to self-hosters too: the engine changes are additive and deliberate.
- The request bytes on the non-basis path are byte-for-byte unchanged, so every
  existing caller stays on exactly the path they are on today.
- SDK (`sdks/typescript`), MCP tool definitions (`crw-mcp-proto`) and the
  OpenAPI spec carry the `basis` request flag and the evidence response types.
