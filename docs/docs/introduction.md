  <p class="page-subtitle">Turn websites into usable data with one API. Start with a single <code>scrape</code> request, then move into <code>search</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>crawl</code>, <code>extract</code>, or MCP only when your workflow actually needs them. Interactive browser automation is handled by the companion <code>crw-browse</code> service.</p>

> **New to CRW? Use `/v1`.** The `/v1` routes are the native fastCRW API for new integrations. Use `/firecrawl/v2` when migrating existing Firecrawl v2 SDK code or when you need compatibility-only routes such as batch scrape or PDF parse.

## Does this work for me?

| I want to… | Use |
|---|---|
| Scrape a known URL → markdown / JSON | **scrape** |
| Discover all pages under a domain | **map** |
| Crawl and scrape many pages in one job | **crawl** |
| Find relevant URLs via web search | **search** |
| Pull structured data with an LLM | **extract** |
| Drive a real browser, click, fill forms | **crw-browse** (companion service) |
| Give my AI agent live web access | **MCP** |

All five core verbs share the same API key and base URL. You can mix them in a single workflow.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.fastcrw.com/v1/scrape \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "formats": ["markdown"]
  }'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "markdown": "# Example Domain\n\nThis domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents.",
    "metadata": {
      "title": "Example Domain",
      "sourceURL": "https://example.com",
      "statusCode": 200,
      "renderedWith": "http",
      "elapsedMs": 218
    }
  }
}
```

## Why teams switch to CRW

CRW is meant to feel easy on day one without closing off the more serious use cases:

- one native `/v1` API surface for single-page scrape, discovery, bounded crawl, search, and extraction,
- a `/firecrawl/v2` Firecrawl compatibility layer for migration work,
- low-ops self-hosting when you need infra control,
- and a built-in MCP server for agent workflows.

## Benchmarks

Public 3-way run on [Firecrawl scrape-content-dataset-v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/firecrawl/scrape-content-dataset-v1), full 1000 URL, canonical `diagnose_3way.py` harness (concurrency 5 / timeout 120s):

| Metric | CRW | crawl4ai | Firecrawl |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Truth-recall (522/819 labeled URLs)** <sup>recall mode</sup> | **63.74%** | 59.95% | 56.04% |
| **p50 latency** | **1914ms** | 1916ms | 2305ms |
| **p90 latency** <sup>fast mode</sup> | **4348ms** | 4754ms | 6937ms |
| Thrown errors (3000 requests) | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Dependencies | single binary | Python + Playwright | Node + Redis + PG + RabbitMQ |

CRW leads on every axis — top truth-recall, fastest median, and the lowest p90 tail — with **0 thrown errors** across all 3,000 requests, and it uniquely recovers **34 URLs the other two miss** (70% more than crawl4ai and Firecrawl combined). The 63.74% denominator is **819 labeled/matchable URLs**, not 3,000 requests, not 1,000. **Two modes, one binary, one config toggle:** *recall mode* maximizes truth-recall; *fast mode* (LightPanda-only) drives the p90 tail to **4348ms, the lowest of the three**. Full result: [`bench/server-runs/RESULT_3WAY_1000_FULL.md`](https://github.com/us/crw/blob/main/bench/server-runs/RESULT_3WAY_1000_FULL.md).
