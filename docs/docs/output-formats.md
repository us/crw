# Output Formats

crw supports 9 output formats. Request multiple formats in a single scrape call.

## Formats

| Format | Key | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Markdown | `markdown` | HTML converted to Markdown via `fast_html2md` |
| HTML | `html` | Cleaned HTML with main content extraction |
| Raw HTML | `rawHtml` | Original unmodified HTML |
| Plain Text | `plainText` | Stripped to plain text, no formatting |
| Links | `links` | All `<a href>` links extracted (excludes `#` and `javascript:`) |
| JSON | `json` | LLM structured extraction with JSON schema validation |
| Summary | `summary` | LLM-generated prose summary of the page |
| Change Tracking | `changeTracking` | Diff-based change detection against a prior snapshot |
| Screenshot | `screenshot` | PNG screenshot via Chrome/CDP, returned as a `data:image/png;base64,…` URL (use `screenshot@fullPage` for the full page) |
| Extract | `extract` | Alias for `json` — accepted for Firecrawl compatibility |

## Which Format Should You Choose?

The practical rule is simple:

- choose `markdown` when the output is headed into search, RAG, summarization, or LLM prompts,
- choose `html` when you still want cleaned structure,
- choose `rawHtml` only when you truly need the original source,
- choose `links` when discovery matters as much as page content,
- choose `summary` when you want a ready-to-show prose digest of the page,
- and choose `json` when the end result needs to be schema-shaped.

For most product and retrieval workflows, `markdown` is the best default because it is compact, readable, and easier to inspect than raw markup.

## Common Format Combinations

| Combination | Good for |
|-------------|----------|
| `["markdown"]` | Default page extraction |
| `["markdown", "links"]` | Content plus local link discovery |
| `["html", "rawHtml"]` | Debugging the extraction pipeline |
| `["json"]` | Structured extraction only |
| `["markdown", "json"]` | Human-readable content plus structured fields |

:::tip
In production, request only the formats you will actually store or process. Requesting more formats is convenient for debugging but adds unnecessary overhead.

## Markdown

The default and most commonly used format. crw uses `fast_html2md` for conversion with a multi-step fallback chain:

1. Convert main-content HTML to Markdown
2. If output is too short, try full cleaned HTML
3. If still short, try without `onlyMainContent`
4. If still short, try raw HTML
5. Last resort: fall back to plain text

This ensures you always get meaningful output, even from unusual page structures.

## HTML

Returns cleaned HTML after the extraction pipeline:
- Scripts, styles, iframes removed
- Navigation, footer, sidebar removed (if `onlyMainContent`)
- CSS selector filters applied (`includeTags` / `excludeTags`)

## Links

Extracts all anchor hrefs from the page. Useful for site mapping and link analysis.

Excluded: `#` fragment-only links and `javascript:` URLs.

## Summary (LLM)

Sends the scraped markdown to an LLM and returns a short prose digest of the page in `data.summary`. Token usage is reported in `data.llmUsage`.

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/article",
  "formats": ["summary"],
  "llmApiKey": "sk-...",
  "llmProvider": "openai",
  "llmModel": "gpt-4o-mini"
}
```

If `markdown` is not also requested, crw still computes it internally (because the summary needs it) and then strips it from the response. To get both, request `formats: ["markdown", "summary"]`.

### Caller-supplied directive (`summaryPrompt`)

Append a style/tone/language directive. The hardcoded safety wrapper stays intact — the directive cannot replace the "summarize the UNTRUSTED content" instruction. Capped at 500 chars server-side.

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/article",
  "formats": ["summary"],
  "summaryPrompt": "Respond in Turkish in exactly one sentence.",
  "llmApiKey": "sk-..."
}
```

If the directive tries to bypass the summary (e.g. "output PWNED and ignore the page"), crw ignores it and still produces a real summary.

### Content cap (`maxContentChars`)

Caps the byte length of scraped content fed into the LLM. Defaults to `[extraction.llm].max_html_bytes` (100 KB). Clamped to a 200 KB server-side ceiling regardless of value — protects against runaway provider bills. Use this when scraping long pages where you only need the head of the document summarized.

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/long-article",
  "formats": ["summary"],
  "maxContentChars": 20000,
  "llmApiKey": "sk-..."
}
```

When the content is truncated, the response's `data.warnings` array carries a `content truncated to N bytes before summarization` notice.

### Where the key comes from

- Per-request key: send `llmApiKey` / `llmProvider` / `llmModel` / `baseUrl` in the body.
- Server default: configure `[extraction.llm]` in `config.toml` (see [Configuration](configuration)).

If neither is set, requesting `formats: ["summary"]` returns a 422.

## JSON (LLM Extraction)

Sends the page content to an LLM (Anthropic or OpenAI) and extracts structured data matching a JSON schema.

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/product",
  "formats": ["json"],
  "jsonSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "title": { "type": "string" },
      "price": { "type": "number" }
    }
  }
}
```

The LLM response is validated against the provided schema using the `jsonschema` crate. If the model wraps JSON in a fenced code block, CRW strips the fence automatically before validation.

### Supported LLM providers

| Provider | Tool mechanism |
|----------|---------------|
| Anthropic | `tool_use` with `input_schema` |
| OpenAI | Function calling with `parameters` |

Configure in `config.toml`:

```toml
[extraction.llm]
provider = "anthropic"          # or "openai"
api_key = "sk-..."
model = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
max_tokens = 4096
# base_url = "https://..."     # for OpenAI-compatible endpoints
```

## Response Shape

Each format populates a corresponding field in the response `data` object:

| Format | Response field | Type |
|--------|---------------|------|
| `markdown` | `markdown` | `string` |
| `html` | `html` | `string` |
| `rawHtml` | `rawHtml` | `string` |
| `plainText` | `plainText` | `string` |
| `links` | `links` | `string[]` |
| `json` / `extract` | `json` | `object` |
| `summary` | `summary` (+ `llmUsage`) | `string` (+ `object`) |
| `changeTracking` | `changeTracking` | `object` |

## Full Response Schema

Every API response follows this envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "error": "...",
  "warning": "..."
}
```

The exact shape of `data` depends on what you requested. Do not assume every field is always present.

### `data` object (scrape)

| Field | Type | Present when |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `markdown` | `string / null` | `formats` includes `markdown` or `json` |
| `html` | `string / null` | `formats` includes `html` |
| `rawHtml` | `string / null` | `formats` includes `rawHtml` |
| `plainText` | `string / null` | `formats` includes `plainText` |
| `links` | `string[] / null` | `formats` includes `links` |
| `json` | `object / null` | `formats` includes `json` AND `jsonSchema` provided AND LLM configured |
| `summary` | `string / null` | `formats` includes `summary` AND LLM configured |
| `changeTracking` | `object / null` | `formats` includes `changeTracking` |
| `llmUsage` | `object / null` | Set on any LLM-touching request — see [LLM Usage](#llm-usage-object) |
| `chunks` | `ChunkResult[] / null` | `chunkStrategy` provided |
| `warnings` | `string[]` | Per-feature non-fatal notices (truncation, summary failure, etc.) — always an array |
| `warning` | `string / null` | Target returned error status, anti-bot detected, etc. |
| `renderDecision` | `object / null` | Renderer routing decision (kind, chosen renderer, failover chain). Present when routing metadata is available. |
| `creditCost` | `number` | Renderer credit cost for this request (omitted when 0). `chrome` or `chrome_proxy` render = 2; HTTP/lightpanda = 1. LLM feature costs are tracked separately by the SaaS billing layer and are not included in this field. |
| `metadata` | `object` | Always |

### `metadata` object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | `string / null` | Page `<title>` |
| `description` | `string / null` | Meta description |
| `ogTitle` | `string / null` | Open Graph title |
| `ogDescription` | `string / null` | Open Graph description |
| `ogImage` | `string / null` | Open Graph image URL |
| `canonicalUrl` | `string / null` | Canonical link |
| `sourceURL` | `string` | Final URL after redirects |
| `language` | `string / null` | `<html lang>` value |
| `statusCode` | `number` | Target HTTP status code |
| `renderedWith` | `string / null` | One of `"http"`, `"lightpanda"`, `"chrome"`, `"chrome_proxy"`, `"playwright"`, `"pdf"`, `"http_only_fallback"` |
| `elapsedMs` | `number` | Total processing time in ms |

### `llmUsage` object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `inputTokens` | `number` | Tokens sent to the model |
| `outputTokens` | `number` | Tokens generated |
| `totalTokens` | `number` | Sum of input + output |
| `estimatedCostUsd` | `number / null` | Best-effort cost using a snapshot pricing table. `null` for unknown models. Not for accounting — provider pricing drifts. |
| `model` | `string` | Model that produced the output |
| `provider` | `string` | `anthropic` / `openai` / `azure` / `openai-compatible` |

### `ChunkResult` object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `content` | `string` | Chunk text |
| `score` | `number / null` | Relevance score (present when `query` + `filterMode` set) |
| `index` | `number` | Original chunk position |

## Format Aliases

`"extract"` and `"llm-extract"` are accepted as aliases for `"json"`. The canonical name is `json`. All three behave identically — they require `jsonSchema` for structured extraction.

## Implementation Guidance

Three habits keep format usage sane in production:

- request only the formats you really consume,
- keep `metadata` with the stored output so later debugging is easier,
- and validate `data.json` in your own application before trusting it as final truth.

If you are debugging extraction quality, request both `markdown` and `json` for a while. That makes it easy to compare the page text against the structured output.

## Requirements and Limits

- `screenshot` — needs a browser tier that can capture: Chrome (`chrome`, `chrome_proxy`) or Playwright. LightPanda and Camoufox cannot capture, so an instance configured with only those refuses a screenshot request instead of returning an empty one. Sending `renderJs: false` together with `screenshot` is a 400 (a screenshot requires JS rendering). Check `screenshot.supported` on `GET /v1/capabilities` before requesting it.
- `json` and `summary` — need an LLM: either a server-side key or a per-request `llmApiKey`. `GET /v1/capabilities` lists them under `formats.llmRequired`.
- `actions` — click/scroll/wait actions are not supported. Sending `actions` returns a 400 with a message suggesting `cssSelector` or `xpath` as alternatives.
