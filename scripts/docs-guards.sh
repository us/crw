# CI guard for documentation consistency.
#
# Guard 1 — base-URL lint
#   Fails if the string "fastcrw.com/api" (the SaaS-only control-plane base
#   URL) appears in any doc or MCP source file OTHER than the explicitly
#   whitelisted files that intentionally describe the hosted control plane.
#
#   Whitelisted files (all occurrences allowed):
#     docs/docs/monitoring.md  — SaaS control-plane API reference; every
#                                appearance of fastcrw.com/api here is a
#                                legitimate /v1/monitor example or the
#                                "Base URL: https://fastcrw.com/api (hosted)"
#                                note.
#     docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md      — two-namespace explainer that names the URL
#                                once to contrast ENGINE vs SaaS namespaces.
#
#   Self-hosted engine endpoints use https://api.fastcrw.com (different
#   subdomain) and MUST NOT reference the SaaS control-plane base URL.
#
# Guard 2 — SKILL.md divergence check
#   docs/agent-onboarding/SKILL.md and mcp/crw-mcp/skills/SKILL.md must be
#   kept byte-for-byte identical. A diff here means one copy was updated
#   without syncing the other.
#
# Guard 5 — renderer credit-cost truth
#   Derives the current flat renderer price from `credit_for` and rejects stale
#   per-renderer prices in the two user-facing billing/reference pages.
#
# Guard 6: free-tier credit count
#   Fails on a literal flat "1000 credits" / "1000 free" free-tier claim in
#   docs/docs/*.md. The FREE plan grants 500 credits once, plus up to 500 more
#   from onboarding tasks. Hand-maintained: this job has no checkout of
#   crw-saas, so it cannot read `src/lib/plans-client.ts` to derive the number.
#
# Portable: bash + standard POSIX tools plus python3. Works on ubuntu-latest
# and macOS without extra dependencies.

# lie a caller can act on (they design around a feature we actually have, or
# skip a capability check we actually expose). Each pattern below is a claim
# that was true once and is not any more; re-introducing one fails CI.
#
# If a claim here becomes true again (a feature is genuinely removed), delete
# its pattern in the SAME commit that removes the feature.

# and carried these claims too). Excluded: changelogs (they record history, which
# legitimately contains the old claim) and generated HTML (rebuilt from the
# markdown by scripts/build-docs-pages.mjs).
#
# THE GAP EXPRESSION IS `[^.]{0,60}`, NOT `[^|]*`. These claims live
